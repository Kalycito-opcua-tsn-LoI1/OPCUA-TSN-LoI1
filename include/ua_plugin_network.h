 * =====================
 *
 * Connection
 * ----------
 * Client-server connections are represented by a `UA_Connection`. The
 * connection is stateful and stores partially received messages, and so on. In
 * addition, the connection contains function pointers to the underlying
 * networking implementation. An example for this is the `send` function. So the
 * connection encapsulates all the required networking functionality. This lets
 * users on embedded (or otherwise exotic) systems implement their own
 * networking plugins with a clear interface to the main open62541 library. */

 * accept new connections, to call the server with received messages and to
 * signal closed connections to the server.
 *
 * The network layer is part of the server config. So users can provide a custom
 * implementation if the provided example does not fit their architecture. The
 * network layer is invoked only from the server's main loop. So the network
 * layer does not need to be thread-safe. If the networklayer receives a
 * positive duration for blocking listening, the server's main loop will block
 * until a message is received or the duration times out. */
